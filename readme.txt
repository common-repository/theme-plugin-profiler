Make your theme or plugin faster, greener and smarter with this plugin, that will tell you which of your functions is eating up most server time.

== Description ==

The Theme and Plugin Profiler uses a little known PHP feature known as ticks. Basically, this is an internal event that occurs every time a code block is executed, marked (roughly) by a function call or curly {} brackets.

The plugin uses ticks to collect a list of the functions that were executed, how often they were called and how much time they took in total. The pluginâ€™s option page gives some filters to select and sort the results. This will give developers clues which parts of their code demand scrutiny.
